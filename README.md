🎵 Spotify Data Analysis Project
📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes a Spotify dataset using SQL to uncover insights about track characteristics, artist trends, and performance metrics. The dataset includes attributes like energy, liveness, tempo, danceability, and more. The goal is to perform in-depth analysis and extract meaningful insights that can help understand music trends and patterns.

🚀 Features & Key Analysis
✅ Calculated energy-to-liveness ratio to identify high-energy tracks.

✅ Analyzed popularity trends across different genres and artists.

✅ Found tracks with highest/lowest danceability, tempo, and valence.

✅ Aggregated statistics like average tempo, loudness, and acousticness.

✅ Filtered songs by specific conditions (e.g., energy level, duration).

🗄️ Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key columns:

track_name

artist

energy

liveness

tempo

danceability

popularity

valence

acousticness

duration_ms

...and other audio features.
🛠️ How to Use
Import the dataset and SQL file into your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

Run the SQL queries from spotify.sql.

Modify queries as needed to explore additional insights.

🔍 Insights & Results
Most popular tracks are highly danceable and have mid-range energy.

Identified artists consistently producing high-energy tracks.

Found interesting correlations between valence (positivity) and tempo.
